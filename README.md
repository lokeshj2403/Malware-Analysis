# Malware Classification using Deep Learning and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores malware classification using both traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, CNN, and RNN, the project aims to enhance malware  classification, achieving remarkable accuracy with RNN-based models.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 99.11% accuracy using the RNN model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, feature extraction, and transformation.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.2 or later
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib



## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Run the preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python preprocess.py
     ```

2. **Train the Models**:
   - Train machine learning models:
     ```bash
     python train_ml.py --model random_forest
     ```
     Or:
     ```bash
     python train_ml.py --model logistic_regression
     ```
   - Train deep learning models:
     ```bash
     python train_dl.py --model cnn --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
     ```
     Or:
     ```bash
     python train_dl.py --model rnn --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Models**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model rnn
   ```

4. **Predict**:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --model rnn --input_file path/to/sample
   ```
